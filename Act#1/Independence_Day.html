    <p> <b>Date Celebrated:</b> June 12</p>
    <p> <b>Description:</b> Independence Day (Filipino: Araw ng Kasarinl√°n; also known as Araw ng Kalayaan, "Day of Freedom") is a national holiday in the Philippines observed annually on June 12, 
        commemorating the declaration of Philippine independence from Spain in 1898. Since 1978, it has been the country's National Day.</p> 
    <p> <b>History:</b> Bonifacio wrote Viva la independencia Filipina! or Long Live Philippine independence on walls of the cave after the Spanish discovery of the revolutionary group. 
        Bonifacio also led the Cry of Pugad Lawin, which signals the beginning of the Philippine Revolution. Members of the Katipunan, led by Bonifacio, tore their community tax certificates (cedulas personales) 
        in protest of Spanish conquest.
        <br> The Philippine Revolution began in 1896. The Pact of Biak-na-Bato, signed on December 14, 1897, established a truce between the Spanish colonial government and the Filipino revolutionaries. Under its terms, 
        Emilio Aguinaldo and other revolutionary leaders went into exile in Hong Kong after receiving $MXN400,000 from the Spanish Government.
        <br>On August 4, 1964, Republic Act No. 4166 renamed July 4 holiday as "Philippine Republic Day", proclaimed June 12 as "Philippine Independence Day", and enjoined all citizens of the Philippines to observe the latter with befitting rites.</p>
