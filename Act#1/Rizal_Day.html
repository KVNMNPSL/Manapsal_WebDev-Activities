    <p> <b>Date Celebrated:</b> December 30</p>
    <p> <b>Description:</b> Rizal Day (Spanish: Día de Rizal, Filipino: Araw ni Rizal; Tagalog: [riˈsal]) is a Philippine national holiday commemorating life and works of José Rizal, 
        a national hero of the Philippines. It is celebrated every December 30, the anniversary of Rizal's 1896 execution at Bagumbayan (present-day Rizal Park) in Manila. 
        Rizal Day was first instituted with a decree dated December 20, 1898, signed by President Emilio Aguinaldo in Malolos, Bulacan, celebrating December 30, 1898, 
        as a national day of mourning for Rizal and all the victims of the Spanish colonial rule of the Philippines.</p>
    <h2>Who is Jose Rizal?</h2>
    <p> <b>José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda</b> was a Filipino nationalist, writer and polymath active at the end of the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines. 
        He is considered a national hero (pambansang bayani) of the Philippines. An ophthalmologist by profession, Rizal became a writer and a key member of the Filipino Propaganda Movement, 
        which advocated political reforms for the colony under Spain. He was executed by the Spanish colonial government for the crime of rebellion after the Philippine Revolution broke out; the revolution was inspired by his writings. 
        Though he was not actively involved in its planning or conduct, he ultimately approved of its goals, which eventually resulted in Philippine independence.</p>
